If you are experienced creating servers then here is all you need to know:

* recommended RAM: 4GB (will probably run fine on less)
* forge version is in setting.cfg
** FORGEVER=
* Server scripts provided are the standard All The Mods Server-Scripts https://github.com/AllTheMods/Server-Scripts
** they can install forge if needed and used to start server
* set server.properties (or use file provided):
** enable-command-block=true
** allow-flight=true
** recommended: view-distance=10
* world name is "world"
* all players use the same map like a vanilla game

IMPORTANT: Backup your server before doing any updates. This ia a map based pack -- 
so if you update your server and overwrite your map, you will start with a fresh DigSite world. 

If you are not experienced creating servers I strongly recommend working with a service provider
to help you set this server up. I do not offer technical support for basic server administration
issues / questions.
