So you want to run a DigSite server to play multiplayer -- but you don't have a hosting provider?
Sure you can run it on your own computer but can be a total hassle.

I personally highly recommend using Akliz for all your minecraft server needs.
They helped me figure out how to make the DigSite server in the first place (at no cost) and I wasn't even a customer.
I already had a MineCraft Professional Hosting provider that I couldn't get the time of day from on support tickets.
The Akliz guys are quick to answer tickets and have a discord server for basic questions.

They even have an automated DigSite server installer on their control panel so you don't
need figure out how to get the server working. Just click the installer and rename "world-new" to "world". DONE!
It's even super easy to do upgrades of the server when a new version comes out. 

To top that off: Save 20% on your first month when you use code: wideblaze when setting up a new account.

FYI: I'm donating 100% of any Akliz referral earnings to help protect the environment. 
There is only this one tiny spec in an infinite void that humans can survive on. 
Things are changing fast -- and not in a good way. We have to take real action not just tweet about it.

Server Install Instructions:
###########################################################

If you are experienced creating servers then here is all you need to know:

* recommended RAM: 4GB (will probably run fine on less)
* forge version is in setting.cfg
** FORGEVER=
* Server scripts provided are the standard All The Mods Server-Scripts https://github.com/AllTheMods/Server-Scripts
** they can install forge if needed and be used to start server
* set server.properties (or use file provided):
** enable-command-block=true
** allow-flight=true
** recommended: view-distance=10
* world name is "world"
* all players use the same map like a vanilla game

IMPORTANT: Backup your server before doing any updates. This ia a map based pack -- 
so if you update your server and overwrite your map, you will start with a fresh DigSite world. 

If you are not experienced creating servers I strongly recommend working with a service provider
to help you set this server up. I do not offer technical support for basic server administration
issues / questions.
